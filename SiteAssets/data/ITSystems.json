The Bureau of Prisons is standardizing its inmate education program by developing the i-CONNECT Inmate Education Network. This system includes the i-CONNECT Wide Area Network (WAN) and dedicated zero-client Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) workstations that will provide inmates with a variety of education services, such as computer-based adult education courses, vocational training, and GED testing. This system is being established to provide educational resources (training classes and testing) in a captive isolated connection to the resources needed without interconnecting with BOP Information Systems used to complete the BOP\u2019s mission. This isolation of the inmate VDI workstation is to prevent possible access to the internet by inmates within the BOP\u2019s custody. The Computer Services Administration and User Support Branch in a support role with the Education Branch have been working with the contract award vendor Pearson Vue for an inmate GED curriculum for GED test preparation. This required insuring that the system would work in the current i-Connect environment. In addition, as part of the procurement contract the distribution of the electronic material is the responsibility of the BOP. The VMs for the management system for the GED curriculum, along with the courses and additional items we would like to send out to all field sites, exceed the 16GB limit. Per this requirement, a waiver to purchase 64 GB encrypted thumb drives to distribute this material was granted on May 1, 2015. and has been uploaded to the Status/Archive page in CSAM.
