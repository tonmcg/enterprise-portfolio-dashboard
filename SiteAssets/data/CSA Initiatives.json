Tasks include: (1) changing the printer to user ratio to meet the industry norm, (2) Right-size printer capacity to match the needs of the office in which the printer resides; (3) PIV enable network printers; (4) Purchase multi-functional devices instead of separate printers and scanners; (5) Reduce the amount of power (footprint) required to operate the printers; and (6) Implement printer management software to track print jobs and enable print policy to reduce printing throughout DEA. This initiative is currently in a pilot phase and will be rolled out to the entire agency in the next 2-3 years. When fully implemented, the cost avoidance is estimated to be approximately $3 million per year.",

This strategy will retire and replace existing systems in use by DOJ components and avoid build out cost of these systems to comply with directives from the DNI/OPM, Joint Reform Team for compliance to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2005, NIST security standards, etc.  IOC for enterprise system achieved June, 2011.  FOC achieved October 2012 after all data migrated and consolidated.  Savings include estimated O&M costs from systems retirement of several systems and DME cost avoidance to build out these systems to compliance standards.  Savings do not include savings from re-use of existing (reciprocal) investigations, time savings of increased throughput, paperless case files, and automation of processing and correspondence.",

A successful first activity of the team was the elimination of escalation costs for FY13 on one of the Department's enterprise-wide contracts called \"ITSS-4\".  The contracting team for this Department-wide Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) approached all of the vendors to discuss budget realities and requested their consideration on holding billing rates flat for task option years.  Vendors also committed to a critical review of cost proposals on new task orders as well.  Net savings for 2013 are $1.13M with no investment funding required.  Flattened costs in FY 2013 reduce total contract costs even if contractors implement escalation costs in future years due to the compounding nature of annual escalation percentages.\n\nAdditional savings resulting from:\n\n- Army waiving 1% fee on Oracle renewals in FY13, savings of $0.155\n- ITSS-4 vendors maintaining FY12 rates on existing tasks orders for OBDs in FY13, avoidance of $0.876\n- Training offer from FranklinCovey for the Justice Management Division (JMD) in FY13, negotiated a savings of $0.630\n-  Reduced IBM security proposal price through negotiations in Fy14, savings of $0.600",

JABS also pursued the re-certification of existing \"Local Access Coordinators\" at components to coordinate these simple tasks locally.  By changing the user-facing help policy to force the first user call to the component help desk, JABS was able to eliminate the unnecessary calls to JABS and provide the component help desks with easy ways to refer users to solutions to all types of calls that do not require JABS-specific expertise.  This resulted in a savings of $220K in the partial FY 14 and a projected amount of nearly $300K in out years, without materially increasing help desk costs for the components.",

This imposed significant costs and administrative burdens that could prevent or delay the collection process.\n\nThe TAR program provides a means to centralize the address search/validation process.  Under the program, the NCIF sends a file from the Consolidated Debt Collection System to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to obtain the last known address the debtor provided to the IRS.  This program reduces the time and resources required to obtain valid address information and locate the debtor.  \n",

The Debt Collection Management Staff (DCM), Justice Management Division, manages this program for DOJ and routinely refers debts handled by the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices (USAO) to TOP once a judgment has been obtained and other basic Treasury mandated criteria have been met.  In addition to the debts handled by the USAOs, DOJ contracts with PCs to litigate and collect debt on behalf of the United States.  Historically, DCM has not referred to TOP debts being handled by PCs, largely due to contractual constraints impacting administration of the program.  \n\nWith the resolution of contractual issues, DCM began referring all Private Counsel debts (post-judgment) to TOP in FY2014.   This occurred during the 1st Quarter, FY 2014, following enhancements to both systems in DCM (Consolidated Debt Collection System and Debt Management Module) and sufficient notification to both Private Counsel as well as the debtors.   \n",

In addition, network traffic between buildings within the downtown DC area, where the Civil Division is a tenant, has no need to leave the control of the DOJ.  With those two drivers in mind, the Civil Division has stood up a Point to Point Wireless Data Network.  This network directly connects many of the buildings where the Civil Division is a tenant, at a speed of at least 1 Gbps.  The beauty of this system is that after the initial cost to acquire and install the equipment, only a relatively small support contract remains and needs to be renewed.  Meaning after the initial purchase, the cost avoidance begins.",

A legal agreement required IBM to maintain deployed IBM assets for 5 years from the date of sale.  The IBM/Lenovo sale was completed October 1, 2014.  US Intel Community restricted purchases of IBM Blades after completion of sale.  The NGI program explored mitigation options and negotiated with FBI/LM/IBM a full 1 for 1 replacement of NGI hardware and 5 years of maintenance at a substantial discount of $25 million.  The LM modification was signed on September 30, 2014.  IBM sourced world-wide and used maintenance build line to fill the FBI's order.

With the FY15 True up, being looked into at that it was decided in June (Qtr.3 FY15) after reviewing the amount of funds required to purchase enough Visio licenses for the division, it would be more financially prudent to purchase SmartDraw, and begin to transition away from Visio and use solely rely on SmartDraw. CRM’s normal cost for maintaining the number of licenses we had was $3,821.64 for 10 Visio Professional & 64 Visio Standard. The purchase of SmartDraw for the entirety of the Division (1500) was $734.20 (Including CMS Fee).  CRM Purchased SmartDraw through an RA in Qtr. 4 FY15, however was unable to transfer out any of the Visio Licenses. In FY16, CRM was able to transfer out 25 Visio Standard licenses which allowed CRM to avoid $1,146.50. It is CRM intent to continue to try to transfer out Visio Licenses.  ",
